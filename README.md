Hello! I like programming in C++ and Rust, I use the first one at my job together, and both of them for my hobby projects.

I am registered at a couple of sites with programming problems for practice:

1. [CodeAbbey](https://www.codeabbey.com/index/user_profile/telebashna)

2. ProjectEuler

3. [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/douaumont/)

I solve problems there from time to time at my own pace. You should definitely check out CodeAbbey, it has a really good community.

douaumont/douaumont is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
